    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "### 1. Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Decision Trees are great when analyzing customer data. It can be helpful to know who will be more likely to purchase or use items so you can aim marketing towards those specific customers. For example, when you receive Movie recommendations on a website it might be using a decision tree based on movies you've watched previously (i.e. x% of people who enjoyed Lord of the Rings also enjoyed Game of Thrones). \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### b. What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "    They are simple to understand and can be visualized easily, making them great to present to stakeholders. They also do not require a lot of data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Prone to overfitting data, can create biased trees if the data isn't balanced, and can be unstable with some data. It does not perform well with data that is unrefinded because it may create complex trees that do not generalize the data well and is not adaptive or flexible to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Decision Trees would make a great candidate model for this problem because it bases predictions of data off of simple decisions inferred from data that has been collected. We could use this model to find what donors make over 50k based on their education, ocupation, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html\n",

    "### 2. Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The medical field commonly uses Random Forests when determining if someone has an illness or disease. Each disease has it's own random forest that the medical professional would feed the symptoms into and they would be run through every tree to see if the patient has the disease or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Random Forests are versatile and and scalable. They perform well when you have a large amount of data that can be bootstrapped from and many trees are created to average out the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Random Forests are more complex than decision trees and with large datasets this leads to training time being longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Random Forest could be great for this problem because it solves the problem of overfitting if the company decides to add more data in the future. It is also great because Random Forests do best with categorical data and since the ultimate goal is to predict donors who's income is over 50k a year, that perfectly qualifies using a Random Forest model. \n",

    "### 3. AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "    AdaBoost is commonly used for image and text based classification because it is great at reducing complexity by finding the most important features and giving them a strong weight / say.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "    AdaBoost's strength is in adaptability by combining weak learners to strengthen them and form a strong classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "    AdaBoost has a weakness to outliers and noisy data. This is due to AdaBoost assigning more say to misclassifications in an attempt to correct the prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "    AdaBoost is a great candidate due to the problem being a complex classification. AdaBoost will weigh all of the columns and create a series of stumps to find the most important features that predict an income of over 50k. \n",

    "    AdaBoost is most appropriate for the task of finding people who have an income greater than 50k. Although AdaBoost requires more training time, they make up for it in having the highest testing scores. To find people who are more likely to donate, AdaBoost outperforms the other models do to the complexity of the data as there are many subsets of data to consider when finding the most important variables. AdaBoost's accuracy remains consistent over all amounts of data (1%, 10%, and 100%) and the accuracy increases with the more data used. This also speaks to how adaptive and scalable AdaBoost is."

    "    The model AdaBoost works by creating multiple simple decisions (stumps, or a simple 'true or false') to find weak learners (classifications that perform poorly, but a bit better than random guessing) and combine them to create a strong learner. Other models like Random Forests and Decision Trees assign the same weight (bias or amount of say in a decision) to each classification, where AdaBoost focuses on strengthening the misclassifications until they are correct. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: You collect information on a group of people, some have diabetes and some do not. You want to predict if someone has diabetes based on some information about them like their weight, age, and if they have pain in their hands or feet. Since AdaBoost uses a model of stumps, they would look like: 'True or False: x age has diabetes', 'True or False: x weight has diabetes', and 'True or False: pain in their hands or feet has diabetes'. Assume that the majority of people who have pain in their hands or feet have diabetes ('True: pain in hands or feet' and 'True: has diabetes'). However, a couple of people with diabetes do not have pain in their hands or feet. AdaBoost would focus on the data that was misclassified ('False: pain in hands or feet' and 'True: has diabetes') by assigning them a higher sample weight and creating a new set of stumps until the model has perfected the classification. \n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "    I was close on education_level, but I overlooked how education-num was likely easier to calculate the importance. This is likely due to the education-num values being numerical and assigning weights to each value in education_level. My feature prediction of age and hours-per-week were correct, however I am surprised that occupation is not an important feature. The most important feature being capital-loss does make sense, that would be a great predictor to see who is realizing losses in their income. I focused too much on what would increase a person's income instead of looking at predictors of low income (capital-loss)."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
